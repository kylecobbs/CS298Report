One of the challenges of combating mobile malware in Android devices is attributed to code obfuscation. Malware writers obfuscate the source code of their programs by employing various techniques that attempt to hide the true intent of the program. Malware detectors use a handful of features to classify a program as a malware. If the malware detector uses a feature that is obfuscated, then the malware detector will fail to classify it as a malicious software. In this survey, we look at works of literature that discuss code obfuscation in malware and the challenges faced by malware detectors to combat the code obfuscation.
